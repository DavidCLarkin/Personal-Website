It encourages players to learn from past mistakes through difficult bosses and their unforgiving mechanics. Dying means losing progress in the current dungeon and having to try again. Dungeons are generated procedurally so that every play session is unique. Combat is mainly melee based but some weapons that are obtained through boss loot can come equipped with perks that have ranged abilities. Upgradable stats make for in-depth character progression along with the looting system from overcoming a boss encounter. Adrift has been released on Itch.io as a free to play game."},"image":{"fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/muk1dsfdlq3c/70JDMiFjjZl9x952N4fCjz/8547c6d667187867842e663467f3eabf/MainMenuPostChangeCentered__2_.png?w=800&q=50"},"description":"Logo for the Adrift game"},"imageTwo":[{"id":"268ed148-0c49-5868-835e-c2fc3711f2c2","fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/muk1dsfdlq3c/70JDMiFjjZl9x952N4fCjz/8547c6d667187867842e663467f3eabf/MainMenuPostChangeCentered__2_.png?w=800&q=50"},"description":"Logo for the Adrift game"},{"id":"9d6fc352-d48e-553c-b51d-b44f9023f6be","fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/muk1dsfdlq3c/2NZiom6C7iq5s06Mix6QqC/fefc537052562176cddf065c69ea775d/DemonBossAbility1.png?w=800&q=50"},"description":"Boss using a circular ability"},{"id":"9b86c050-c551-5e4b-82fe-e8aa68c32cac","fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/muk1dsfdlq3c/5Cfc79yYesGsjf1wOIfDXs/6782ca2f0a35f08fc5ea76c2e8e0e53e/RandomDungeon3.png?w=800&q=50"},"description":"A random level via procedural generation"}],"githubLink":"https://github.com/DavidCLarkin/2D-RPG-GAME"}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"projectTitle":"Adrift"}}}
