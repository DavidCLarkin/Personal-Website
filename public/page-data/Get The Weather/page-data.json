Designed wireframes in Figma and translated it to code for prototyping. Took a mobile-first approach to make sure it would be responsive and look appealing on a smaller viewport. Implemented geolocation services so that the user can fetch weather data from their current location. Error handling implemented for fetch requests and if user input is invalid. They can also search for a city and country to get the weather all around the world.
