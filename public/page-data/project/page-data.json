The game features procedural level generation using an algorithm vaguely inspired by the Random Walk algorithm. I implemented an inventory and item system through use of object oriented designs (Inheritence). The enemy AI uses A* pathfinding, catering to the procedural level generation algorithm. A lot of the features also use a component based design for less code duplication and more reusability. Finally, delegation via the Event system in C# is used to decouple as much code as possible. Adrift has been released on Itch.io as a free to play game."},"image":{"fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/muk1dsfdlq3c/1wnugNVK0KCzQbwWuVehr1/37b583ddfdc1a5d75fb9794bf1f2d18c/MainMenuPostChangeCentered__2_.png?w=800&q=50"},"description":"Adrift-logo-image"},"imageTwo":[{"id":"268ed148-0c49-5868-835e-c2fc3711f2c2","fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/muk1dsfdlq3c/70JDMiFjjZl9x952N4fCjz/3c0e145aac2d25be66a33a5b9978d9b8/adriftMainScreen.png?w=800&q=50"},"description":"adrift-main-menu-screen"},{"id":"9b86c050-c551-5e4b-82fe-e8aa68c32cac","fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/muk1dsfdlq3c/5Cfc79yYesGsjf1wOIfDXs/5423fc2a142dc5c0fd22cc210629d504/RandomDungeon2.png?w=800&q=50"},"description":"A-random-level-via-procedural-generation"},{"id":"9d6fc352-d48e-553c-b51d-b44f9023f6be","fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/muk1dsfdlq3c/2NZiom6C7iq5s06Mix6QqC/d1bdd05c40cca992a677b693011e64d5/adriftBossBattleTwo.png?w=800&q=50"},"description":"adrift-boss-battle-two"},{"id":"ef8443ea-ffe5-5afd-a6b5-71f51ee2ad3f","fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/muk1dsfdlq3c/7u6ctiWPBOBRqaqXQnIcO9/a9fe2ad45f7887618dd646fa0e7d50ea/projectComba.png?w=800&q=50"},"description":"combat-in-adrift-image"},{"id":"8578a4d9-2f3e-5f23-93e0-9f4138c4210d","fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/muk1dsfdlq3c/3QKOlD8sDQGXSWAoW1T2IF/a683b73643bd315e144915f78755fcd7/adriftBossBattle.png?w=800&q=50"},"description":"adrift-boss-battle-one-image"}],"githubLink":"https://github.com/DavidCLarkin/2D-RPG-GAME"}},{"node":{"id":"d7c2f67c-f539-57d4-ac66-03b5b947687b","title":"Brophy Brothers","date":"August 2019","link":"https://brophybrothers.netlify.com/","technologies":["React","HTML","Sass","JavaScript","Gatsby","Netlify","Contentful","Git"],"description":{"description":"Brophy Brothers is a wholesale produce supplier website built by dazzle works.
