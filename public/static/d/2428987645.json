It encourages players to learn from past mistakes through difficult bosses and their unforgiving mechanics. Dying means losing progress in the current dungeon and having to try again. Dungeons are generated procedurally so that every play session is unique. Combat is mainly melee based but some weapons that are obtained through boss loot can come equipped with perks that have ranged abilities. Upgradable stats make for in-depth character progression along with the looting system from overcoming a boss encounter. Adrift has been released on Itch.io as a free to play game."},"image":{"fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/muk1dsfdlq3c/70JDMiFjjZl9x952N4fCjz/8547c6d667187867842e663467f3eabf/MainMenuPostChangeCentered__2_.png?w=800&q=50"},"description":"Logo for the Adrift game"}}},{"node":{"id":"46aafd1c-f55f-5bc1-802d-c8aa7b3c1655","title":"Personal Website","date":"November 2019","link":"https://practical-clarke-e5ba2d.netlify.com/","description":{"description":"My personal portfolio is a way to display the work that I've completed. Developing this website was part of a learning process to engage with front-end development. Needing an online presence to portray some of my projects, this site came to life. I both designed and coded the whole project which gave me a new love for web development that I didn't have previously. Similar to game development, I got to test and fiddle around with big features like UI/UX to smaller features such as small animations sprinkled around the website.
